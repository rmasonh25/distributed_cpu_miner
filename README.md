This component is designed for:
- Solo CPU-based mining against your own node or private pool
- Configurable mining step (instead of default nonce += 1)
- Deployment across many machines via Docker
- Centralized orchestration and wallet binding
- Works on Raspberry Pi, Linux, or any Docker-supported device

```bash
./distributed_cpu_miner \
  --range-start 0 \
